## ✨ Improvements

### Enhanced Error Messages for Module Extraction Failures

When the script encounters corrupted or missing VMware module files, users now receive:

**1. Clear Warning About Root Causes:**
```
[!] MODULES MAY BE BROKEN!
  This often happens due to:
  • Previous attempts to patch modules using other scripts from the internet
  • Manual modifications to VMware module files
  • Corrupted VMware installation
```

**2. Immediate, Actionable Solution:**
```
[!] RECOMMENDED SOLUTION:
  1. Completely uninstall VMware Workstation:
     sudo vmware-installer -u vmware-workstation
  2. Remove leftover files:
     sudo rm -rf /usr/lib/vmware /etc/vmware
  3. Reinstall VMware Workstation from official download
  4. Run this script again
```

**3. Explicit Mention of Common Issues:**
- Warns users that previous patching attempts using other internet scripts may have broken their modules
- Explains that manual modifications are a common cause
- Provides step-by-step reinstallation instructions directly in the error output

## 🔄 Why This Update?

- ✅ **Eliminates confusion** - Users immediately understand what went wrong
- ✅ **Saves time** - No need to search documentation or forums
- ✅ **Prevents frustration** - Clear path to resolution right in the terminal
